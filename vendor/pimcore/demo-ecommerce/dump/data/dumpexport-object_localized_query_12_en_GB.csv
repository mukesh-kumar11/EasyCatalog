6037	en_GB	RUNlight New York W	Road Running Shoe RUNlight New York Women	Turquoise/yellow	12.7800	\N	0	 If you run on a regular basis, your best choice is an ultra lightweight running shoe that is well cushioned and durable without adding unnecessary weight to your foot. For underpronating to neutral runners, the PRO TOUCH New York W from the women&rsquo;s RUNlight collection is the ideal footwear for hard surfaces like tarmac, gravel, or solid soil. The most lightweight but durable performance materials were chosen for this shoe to offer sock-like fit and maximum comfort at minimal weight. The soft and breathable synthetic mesh/PU upper feels extremely light, yet providing enough stability and foothold for a safe run. The low-weight internal Pro Bridge delivers the energy from impact to toe-off to allow a smooth and efficient running style. For a dry and odourless climate inside the New York W, the anatomically shaped and pre-moulded OrthoLite&reg; insole is breathable, moisture wicking, and anti-microbial. In combination with the lightweight Pro Cushion midsole construction with focus on rear and forefoot cushioning, this lightweight midsole provides superior shock absorption and durability at minimal weight. The shoe&rsquo;s non-marking Dura Grip rubber outsole guarantees reliable grip on all surfaces and additional cushioning. Available in color: Turquoise/yellow and white/blue/pink 		\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
