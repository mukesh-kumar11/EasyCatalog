\	The new OZ Pro for women may look reduced, sleek and modern, but it is one of PRO TOUCH&rsquo;s best-cushioned running shoes for neutral-gait runners. The shoe features Cushion Fit, which is a midsole construction designed to reliably absorb shock and provide high comfort at a very low weight. Many other components of the shoe like the upper and parts of the sole construction were also redesigned to be lighter than in any other PRO TOUCH running shoe. The Easy Grip outsole is very abrasion-resistant and offers good and reliable grip. On the inside of the OZ Pro W, a breathable OrthoLite&reg; insole ensures great fit as well as perfect moisture management and an odourless and bacteria-free foot climate.&nbsp;</p>\

\	PRO TOUCH&rsquo;s top trail running shoe Ridge Trail AQM for men is fully equipped and designed for serious trail action. The rough Pro Grip outsole is made of a special rubber compound offering superior grip on every terrain and surface. The Ridge Trail AQM was also designed to offer a maximum of comfort, which is realized by integrating a Cushion Fit midsole that reliably absorbs shock while being extremely lightweight. PRO TOUCH&rsquo;s Quick Lace System provides an evenly distributed pressure around the entire foot, resulting in a significantly improved tight and comfortable fit. Since you should always be prepared for any kind of weather, the Ridge Trail features an upper made of light canvas, mesh, and synthetics with an integrated waterproof, windproof, and breathable Aquamax&reg; membrane. This technology does not only keep the rain out, it also regulates the foot climate and keeps you comfortable and dry inside your shoes at all times. Last, but not least, a well cushioned and pre-moulded OrthoLite&reg; insole guarantees additional breathability and avoids odours and bacteria that may develop around the foot during long and intense runs.</p>\

\	The women&rsquo;s version of the Chicago Stability running shoe was adapted to women&rsquo;s specific needs. It&rsquo;s a comfortable and breathable running shoe for beginners to intermediate runners, offering plenty of guidance for a neutral gait. The shoe features an anatomically shaped and pre-moulded I-Shape insole for superior stability and fit. The Cushion Fit midsole construction of the Chicago Stability is designed to reliably absorb shock and provide high comfort. The weight of the Cushion Fit midsole is reduced to the minimum, without compromising its durability. Whilst reducing the overall weight of the shoe, the stability was improved by integrating a Control Bridge moulded arch support around the midfoot area. The advanced Dura Grip outsole material provides enhanced grip and added durability for road running</p>\

The upper consists of tough PU and a lightweight technical mesh to ensure high breathability &nbsp;and comfort. The pre-shaped OrthoLite&reg; insole is highly breathable, long lasting and anti-microbial. In combination with the lightweight midsole compound, it provides superior cushioning and durability. The ProBridge is a lightweight arch support that provides additional torsional rigidity in the midfoot while retaining the structural integrity of the shoe. The non-marking Pro Grip outsole has premium grip characteristics and a high abrasion resistance.&nbsp;</p>\

On the inside of the OZ Pro W, a breathable OrthoLite&reg; insole ensures great fit as well as perfect moisture management and an odourless and bacteria-free foot climate.&nbsp;</p>\

\	This lightweight men&rsquo;s running shoe is designed for serious, underpronating to neutral runners who work out or compete on a regular basis, preferably on hard surfaces like tarmac, gravel, or solid soil. For a sock-like fit and maximum comfort, the New York from PRO TOUCH&rsquo;s RUNlight collection is made of the lightest, yet durable performance materials available. This starts with a synthetic mesh/PU mix of the upper construction, which delivers an incredible light feeling. At the same time the material is soft, breathable, and still stable enough to provide enough foothold around the ankle for a safe run. The low-weight internal Pro Bridge delivers the energy from impact to toe-off to allow a smooth and efficient running style. For a dry feeling under the foot, the anatomically shaped and pre-moulded OrthoLite&reg; insole is breathable, moisture wicking, and anti-microbial. In combination with the lightweight Pro Cushion midsole construction with focus on rear and forefoot cushioning, this lightweight midsole provides superior shock absorption and durability at minimal weight. A non-marking Dura Grip rubber outsole adds cushioning and reliable friction without adding one unnecessary gram to the construction.</p>\

\	The new PRO TOUCH RidgeLite is the ideal shoe for female trail runners looking for a lightweight model for less fatiguing workouts. The RidgeLite is deigned for neutral runners with a high arch. All components of this new trail running shoe were selected to offer maximum comfort at minimum weight: a breathable mesh upper with a mix of resistant materials managing all kind of terrains, a Cushion Fit midsole for great shock absorption, and a rugged Pro Grip outsole made of a special rubber compound offering superior grip on slippery terrains and wet conditions. The Quick Lace System provides evenly distributed pressure around the entire foot, resulting in a significantly improved tight, but very comfortable fit. The breathable and anatomically pre-moulded OrthoLite&reg; insole avoids unpleasant odours or bacteria that may develop around the foot during long and intense runs.</p>\

\	The lightweight Broxton Bermuda for men is an ideal short pant for all mountain and outdoor sports. The light and stretchable fabric has a very technical look and features DRY PLUS moisture technology, which guarantees reliable moisture transport and maximum comfort. As a result, the pant dries quickly and the skin never feels wet or overheated. In addition, the Polygiene&reg; antimicrobial technology safely inhibits the growth of odour-causing bacteria and fungi. Polygiene&reg; does not affect the natural bacterial flora of your skin, and without odour-causing bacteria, you stay fresh. Thanks to the comfortable cut and stretch fabric, the Broxton Bermuda is also great for bouldering or climbing, allowing unrestricted freedom of movement. Two open front pockets, one zipped safety front pocket, and two zipped back pockets offer plenty of space for small items.</p>\

<p>\
\	The perfect pant for rock climbers needs to be abrasion resistant, yet elastic enough to guarantee that none of their moves are restricted. McKINLEY&rsquo;s Mountain-Tec Northfield pant for women achieves both: reinforced areas like the inner leg bottoms, the knees and the seat for additional abrasion resistance, as well as a double-weave robust stretch fabric for full freedom of movement. The fabric of the Northfield pant is equipped with DRY PLUS moisture and boasts a durable water repellent finish and is thus wind and water resistant, breathable, moisture wicking, and fast-drying. The bottom hem is elastic and adjustable. To avoid that you get lost on your way to the top, the thigh pocket is large enough to fit a map.</p>\

\	If you need extra warmth on your trekking expedition or hiking trip without a bulky feel and excessive weight, the women&rsquo;s Lanila padded jacket with PrimaLoft&reg; insulation is not only one of the most functional jackets you can bring, but probably one of the best looking, too. The Lanila can be worn as an insulating mid layer or as an outer layer. A durable water repellent finish makes sure that you don&rsquo;t get soaked. And even if the PrimaLoft&reg; padding should get moist or even wet, it won&rsquo;t loose any of its insulating properties. Besides, the PrimaLoft&reg; fibres are enclosed by a wind-breaking, high-density Polyamid fabric that blocks the wind to keep you warm. Two front pockets and one external chest pocket offer plenty of space for all your valuables, and the elastic binding cuffs guarantee a close and comfortable fit. The entire jacket, including a storm hood, packs into an internal pocket, so you can bring it along anywhere, anytime.</p>\

\	If you need extra warmth on your trekking expedition or hiking trip without a bulky feel and excessive weight, the Lanila padded jacket with PrimaLoft&reg; insulation is probably one of the most functional jackets you can bring.

And even if the PrimaLoft&reg; padding should ever get moist or wet, it won&rsquo;t loose any of its insulating properties. In addition, the PrimaLoft&reg; fibres are inside a wind-breaking, high-density Polyamide fabric that blocks the wind to keep you warm. Two front pockets and one external chest pocket offer plenty of space for all your valuables, and the elastic binding cuffs guarantee a comfortable and tight fit.
