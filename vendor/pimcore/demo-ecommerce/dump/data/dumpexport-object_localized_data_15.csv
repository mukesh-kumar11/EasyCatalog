\	Running light is all about feeling stronger than gravity. Running light is about realizing that we can effortlessly strengthen our body while refining our figure. Running light is about leaving all worries behind and understanding that life is good. Running light is a state of mind: when nothing can stop you; but it&rsquo;s also about feeling more of your body because your gear is lighter. This is why we created the <strong>RUNlight</strong> collection &ndash; lightweight equipment that allows you to maximize the fun!</p>\
