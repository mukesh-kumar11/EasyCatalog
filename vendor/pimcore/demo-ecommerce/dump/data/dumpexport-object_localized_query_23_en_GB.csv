\	Down is a product of nature and is still the best insulation material existing. It is extremely light, has outstanding insulation properties and amazing moisture control for a wonderful dry and warm climate.</p>\
<p>\
\	An important factor that determines the down&#39;s quality is the mix ratio. When plucking the birds, a mixture of down and feathers always comes out. Down binds more air than feathers and provides better insulation. The higher the percentage of down in a filling, the higher the insulation with the same fill weight. A larger proportion of feathers however makes the filling less sensitive to pressure and moisture.</p>\
<p>\
\	Information such as 90/10 means: 100 grams of the filling contains at least 90 grams of down.</p>\
